address = {Newcastle},
annote = {1. Survey - I already know:
General structure, plans, issues.
        
2. Survey - What I do predict I might learn:
A detailed step by step description for my GANTT.
        
3. Questions:
* Which phases?
* When to do what?
* Content of each step?
        
4. Read&Recite:
* Total duration: 3 years
* One step: define a problem
* Proposal contains 6 vitals points
* First step: several month full-time work
* When: during the second year
* Finally, information about each step
        
5. Review:
* A theses proposal contains of 6 items
* Write the proposal after 2 years
* Have preliminary results
* Know the related work
* Have a goal / a stopping condition
* Have a time table
        
6. Reflect - What do I know:
* Time tables
* Structures
* Contents
* Issues
        
7. Reflect - What do I need to know more about:
* Does the "analytical model" idea fit for a proposal?
* When do I know that I know enough related work?
* How to produce prelimiary results as soon as possible?},

@article{Guo:2006,
abstract = {This paper proposes two optical grid resource allocation and task scheduling algorithms, task-based approaches (TBA) and workflow-based approaches (WBA), for data-intensive workflow-based applications. Not only the resource allocation the efficient allocation for the entire workflow but also the network resources contention are considered. An optical grid simulator is developed to investigate the performance of the resource allocation approaches. Experimental results show that WBA can significantly lower execution time than TBA for data-intensive workflow-based applications.},
